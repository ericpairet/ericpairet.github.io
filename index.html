      <h1>Short Biography</h1>

			<!-- I am a second-yaer PhD... -->
			<!-- Different start, not only a PhD student... -->

      <p style="text-align:justify">I am currently a senior researcher at <a href="https://tii.ae/" class="body">The Technology Innovation Institute</a>, Abu Dhabi (UAE) with 8+ years of experience in innovative robotics research, and a total of 15+ years devoted at different levels of the technology sector. I obtained my PhD from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" class="body">The University of Edinburgh</a> and <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" class="body">Heriot-Watt University</a> (<a href="http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" class="body">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics (ECR)</a>) while occupying a researcher position in the <a href="https://orcahub.org/" class="body">ORCA Hub</a> programme and providing robotic consultancy services to the industry. Prior to this, I combined my master and undergraduate studies with researcher and engineer positions at different academic institutions, as well as led and participated in multiple robotic competitions.</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify">I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyoles" class="body">Banyoles</a>, a beatiful village located in the northeastern Catalonia (Spain). I got my BSc in Electronic and Automation Engineering from the <a href="https://www.udg.edu/" class="body">University of Girona</a> (Spain). Eager to translate my knowledge into practice, I combined my years of bachelors working on industrial automation for private companies, and doing research on underwater robotics in the <a href="http://cirs.udg.edu/"class="body">Underwater Vision and Robotics Research Centre (CIRS)</a>, where I stayed until I got my Erasmus Mundus MSc in <a href="http://www.vibot.org/joint-msc-in-vision--robotics.html" class="body">Computer Vision and Robotics (VIBOT)</a> from the <a href="http://en.u-bourgogne.fr/" class="body">University of Burgundy</a> (France), <a href="https://www.udg.edu/" class="body">University of Girona</a> (Spain) and <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" class="body">Heriot-Watt University</a> (UK). Then, I accepted an offer of a four-year joint-PhD training programme at the <a href="http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" class="body">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics (ECR)</a>. For the first year of the programme, I was awarded a MSc in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" class="body">The University of Edinburgh</a> and <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" class="body">Heriot-Watt University</a>.</p>
