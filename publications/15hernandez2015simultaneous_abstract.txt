New potential applications of autonomous under- water vehicles (AUVs) involve operations in unknown and cluttered environments, therefore increasing the vehicle expo- sure to collisions. To cope with these situations, we use an AUV framework for planning collision-free paths in unknown environments, which adapt and replan the paths according to nearby obstacles perceived during the mission execution using different range sensing sonar. We present simulation and real- world results for the SPARUS-II AUV, a torpedo-shaped vehicle, performing autonomous missions.
