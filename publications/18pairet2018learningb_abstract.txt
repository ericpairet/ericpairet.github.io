Robots are becoming a vital ingredient in society. Some of their daily tasks require dual-arm manipulation skills in the rapidly changing, dynamic and unpredictable real-world en- vironments where they have to operate. Given the expertise of humans in conducting these activities, it is natural to study humansâ€™ motions to use the resulting knowledge in robotic control. With this in mind, this work leverages human knowl- edge to formulate a more general, real-time, and less task- specific framework for dual-arm manipulation. The proposed framework is evaluated on the iCub humanoid robot and sev- eral synthetic experiments, by conducting a dual-arm pick- and-place task of a parcel in the presence of unexpected ob- stacles. Results suggest the suitability of the method towards robust and generalisable dual-arm manipulation.
