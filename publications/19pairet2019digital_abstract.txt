To avoid putting humans at risk, there is an imminent need to pursue autonomous robotised facilities with maintenance capabilities in the energy industry. This paper presents a video of the ORCA Hub simulator, a framework which unifies three types of autonomous systems (Husky, ANYmal and UAVs) on an offshore platform for training and testing human-robot collaboration scenarios such as inspection and emergency response.
