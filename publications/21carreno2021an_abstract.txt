Robotics opens the possibility for safer operations in remote and hazardous environments, with multiple robots deployed to perform tasks that would otherwise present risks for human operators. However, these missions must be carefully planned and monitored to ensure their successful completion while keeping human supervisors in the loop for accountability. While many tools have been developed to tackle individual aspects of such processes, there are few systems combining plan development, review, and supervision in one framework. This paper proposes a mission planning framework designed for remote operations and integrating the following features: a user-friendly problem editor, a task-allocation algorithm, visual plan inspection, digital-twin progression reports, and plan deviation analysis. We show how this system is designed to support non-technical users with planning activities. In particular, the system provides continuous feedback on plan performance, comparing predictions with real implementations, enabling users to improve the requirements for future missions and correct modelling assumptions.
