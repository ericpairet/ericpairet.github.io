This paper presents a robust underwater simultaneous localisation and mapping framework using autonomous relocalisation. The proposed approach strives to maintain a single consistent map during operation and updates its current plan when the SLAM loses feature tracking. The updated plan transverses viewpoints that are likely to aid in merging the current map into the global map. We present the sub-systems of the framework: the SLAM, viewpoint generation, and high level planning. In-water experiments show the advantage of our approach used on an autonomous underwater vehicle performing inspections.
